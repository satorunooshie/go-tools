# Analysis features

## `unusedfunc` reports unused `type`, `var`, and `const` declarations too

<!-- golang/go#40862 -->

The
[unusedfunc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/unusedfunc/)
analyzer now reports any unexported types, variables, and constants
that are unreferenced within their declaring package.
(The problem of unreferenced exported symbols can't be expressed in
the analysis framework since it depends on the entire workspace.)
