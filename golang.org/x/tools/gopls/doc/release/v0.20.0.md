## `ignoredError` inlay hint

The new `ignoredError` inlay hint helps catch mistakenly discarded
errors. It inserts an `// ignore error` hint following any statement
that is a function call whose error result is implicitly ignored. For
example, this code:

```go
f.Close()
```
will appear as:
```go
f.Close() // ignore error
```

To suppress the hint, write an actual comment containing `ignore
error` following the call statement, or explictly assign the result
to a blank `_` variable. A handful of common functions such as
`fmt.Println` are excluded from the check.

Enable it using this configuration: `{"hints": {"ignoredError": true}}`.

## `unusedfunc` reports unused `type`, `var`, and `const` declarations too

<!-- golang/go#40862 -->

The
[unusedfunc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/unusedfunc/)
analyzer now reports any unexported types, variables, and constants
that are unreferenced within their declaring package.
(The problem of unreferenced exported symbols can't be expressed in
the analysis framework since it depends on the entire workspace.)
