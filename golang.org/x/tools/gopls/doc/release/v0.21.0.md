## Configuration changes

- The new `newGoFileHeader` option allows toggling automatic insertion of the copyright comment
  and package declaration in a newly created Go file.

## Web-based features
## Editing features
## Analysis features

<!-- golang/go#60088 -->
The new `reflecttypefor` modernizer simplifies calls to
`reflect.TypeOf` to use `reflect.TypeFor` when the runtime type is
known at compile time. For example, `reflect.TypeOf(uint32(0))`
becomes `reflect.TypeFor[uint32]()`.

## Code transformation features

<!-- golang/go#42301 -->
The Rename operation now treats [Doc Links](https://tip.golang.org/doc/comment#doclinks)
like identifiers, so you can initiate a renaming from a Doc Link.
